    <img style="height:30em" src="res/jak_bio.PNG" />
    <p class="info">Jakinda is a Cape Town-based artist, musician and filmmaker originally from Johannesburg. His work is an exploration of afro-futurism, black masculinity and a spiritual journey of self-discovery.</p>
    <p class="info">In the period since the release of his debut EP I Can’t Sleep, in 2016, Jakinda established himself as one of the most exciting and most forward thinking electronic music producers in South Africa. Together with AyemaProbllem, he formed the electronic music duo, Stiff Pap, with Jakinda on production and Ayema as the vocalist. Their debut EP, Based On a Qho Story, released in 2017, was met with critical acclaim, both locally and internationally. It was ranked in the top 30 South African hip hop albums of 2017 by Okayafrica, with its lead single “Dlala” being chosen as one of the best releases of 2016 by Red Bull Studios. While still new to the scene, their exciting live performances gained them a slot on the world-renowned Afropunk Music Festival stage, after winning its inaugural Battle of the Bands in Johannesburg, 2017. Other than Afropunk, Jakinda has performed at the Design Indaba Festival, Red Bull Music Festival and Cape Town Electronic Music Festival all either as a solo artist or as Stiff Pap.</p>
    <p class="info">In January 2017 Jakinda released his second solo EP Afrika 3000, to critical acclaim, further cementing his place as one of the most exciting up and coming artists, both as a group (with Stiff Pap) and as a solo artist. The EP is a culmination of Jakinda’s Afro-futurist influences inspired by traditional Zulu, Masai, Ethiopian and Tanzanian music. He describes his sound as Afro-future electronica, a sound containing elements of Gqom, Tribal-House, Ethiopian Electronica and Kasi-Tech.</p>
    <p class="info">Afrika 3000 received positive reviews from local publications: Platform, Between 10and5 and Bubblegum Club as well as London based publication, Khombo. The EP garnered Jakinda attention from London based platforms Radar Radio, as well as the Beating Heart project,  to which he contributed the song “Lost” on their 2017 South African electronic music album. </p>
    <p class="info">In 2018, Jakinda was a participant in the South African Leg of the world-renowned Africa Express, founded by Damon Albarn (of the U.K. band Gorillaz). During this period Jakinda collaborated with international artists including: the late Dj Spoko, Petite Noir, Nabihah Iqbal and Damon Albarn. He is also one of two South African musicians that were selected for the 20th Anniversary of the Red Bull Music Academy hosted in its founding city Berlin, Germany. He joins other alumni of the academy which include Black Coffee, Culoe De Song, Flying Lotus and Thundercat among many other globally recognised artists. </p>
