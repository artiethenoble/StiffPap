    <p class="info">Established in 2016, the duo describes their sound as Industrial kwaito - a dark intoxicating sound comparable to U.S. punk/hip-hop band Death Grips. With Ayema’s enticing raps and Jakinda’s avant-garde production, the duo is at the cutting edge of African electronic music.</pclass="info">

    <p class="info">In 2017 The duo received major national attention for their explosive live performances, which helped them win  Africa’s inaugural Afropunk Battle of The Bands, earning them a place on the world renowned Afropunk Music Festival main stage.
